## About Us
Hello there üëã! We are proud members of Pod 2.1.3 also know as [Goofy-Goofy](https://goofy-goofy.github.io/) üòÉ. We are tech-explorers üöÄ, highly motivated to learn new things and build cool and random stuff üí•.

## Inspiration
We all know people rely on the internet to search üîé for things that they need. 
 * üõí Shopaholics keep tabs open multiple tabs of shopping websites,
 * üë®‚Äçüíº Workaholics open multiple tabs of their jobs-related sites,  
 * üë©‚Äçüíª Codaholics open multiple tabs of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Google](https://www.google.com/) searches on the Data Structure and Algorithms.
 
It is really frustrating üí¢  to have multiple tabs opened at the same time with more than two Google Chromes. It reduces your accessibility and readability. Moreover, if you lost track or close an important tab my mistake, finding it in your browser history is again a time consuming task. ‚è≥

To solve this, we came up with the solution with the help of our Pod Leader, [Karan](https://github.com/Korusuke).

üì¢ We would like to introduce **"Search Savior"**, a Google Chrome Extension to keep track of the tabs you open from a certain period of time and show it in the webpage as a Tree Structure. üå≥

## What it does?
Google Chrome DevTool Extension that can be turned on/off to track websites that are visited during a search for any random task which might include solving bugs üêû or reaserching about the topic you recently developed interest in ‚úç.  

## Programming Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

###### Since these languages were new to us we refered to [W3 school - HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [W3 school - CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp), [W3 school - JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp) for building our chrome extension
