# Search Savior

## Inspiration
We all know people rely on the internet to search for things that they need. Shopaholics keep tabs open multiple tabs of shopping websites, workaholics open multiple tabs of their jobs-related sites and codaholics open multiple tabs of StackOverflow, GitHub, and Google searches on the Data Structure and Algorithms. It is really frustrating to have multiple tabs opened at the same time with more than two Google Chromes. It does not look good and it only shows tiny logos of the website and you have to go through all of them to find the one. This also prevents you from shutting down your computer or laptop and this can severely damage your devices. To solve this, we came up with the solution with the help of our Pod Leader, Karan. We would like to introduce "Search Savior", a Google Chrome Extension to keep track of the tabs you open from a certain period of time and show it in the webpage in a Tree Structure. 
## What it does
Google Chrome DevTool extension that can be turned on/off to track websites that are visited during a search for how to solve a coding issue/how to implement a feature.
## How we built it
This is our first time building a Chrome Extension. Firstly, we created a simple Chrome Extension to keep track of the tabs that the user currently is. Then, we used Chrome Storage to store the data and then pass it on to the webpage to print them out using AJAX framework. 

We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the landing page for our webpage and Chrome Extension. 
## Challenges we ran into
- Working with JavaScript (it's a pain in the a**)
- Different timezone but we made it work 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
- Teamwork makes the dream work
- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
## What's next for SearchSavior
